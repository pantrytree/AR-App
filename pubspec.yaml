  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", which
  # are described in the following way:
  #
  # For example, to add an image asset named "logo", you would add the following:
  # assets:
  #   - images/logo.png
  #
  # To add a directory of assets, you can also just specify the directory name.
  # For example, to add an entire directory of images, you would add:
  # assets:
  #   - images/
